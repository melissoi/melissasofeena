                    <p>It is all started when I aced my UPSR with flying colours. And my mom suggested me to apply for MRSM, and when it got approved,
                        I had to be interviewed at MRSM Terendak, instead of other MRSM. I still remember the teachers that interviewed me that time. It was such a wonderful memory.
                        After being accepted to study there, we were divided by homeroom, and my homeroom that time was "Phoenix B" which has a few boys and girls. 
                        During my introduction time with my homeroommates and the teacher, I've got to know that my homeroom teacher has the same birthdate as mine.
                        What a coincidence! My homeroommates also are nice. What a luck!

                <h1>MY CLASSMATES!</h1>
                <p>Since we were divided by homeroom, so our classmates also based on homerooms. So, my class was 1B3 which
                    consist of Phoenix A and Phoenix B homerooms. The class system was divided by section, side A which consist of
                    1A1, 1A2, 1A3. and side B have 1B1, 1B2 and 1B3. We have unlimited of memories when we were classmates. We 
                    were unseperatable. Bonds within classmates and the batch clicked sooner than I thought. We may have ups and 
                    down as classmates and batchmates, but we did meetings and stuffs to ensure we solve the misunderstanding. 
                    Being here teaches me to be more mature and considerate as a person.
                </p>
                <p>Before i forgot to mention, usually form 1 students were blessed with having a very beautiful rooms and dorms.
                    So, here I got a nice room with my other 7 roommates. i still remember that we 7 roommates discussed to join 
                    the same uniform for curricular which is taekwondo. So when it comes to curricular, we usually go together. 
                    But at that time, my uniform which is 'Taekwondo' was not active as they are now. We rarely have competitions, 
                    grading or something. Kindly said, i somehow thought i wasted my 3 years of joining 'Taekwondo'. But i will update 
                    about how 'Taekwondo' got changed when I started form 4.
                </p>
                <p>Being in MRSM is about bonding. Throughout the years, lots of activities are conducted that requires a lot of teamwork.
                    I made a list about some activities that was conducted during my lower form years (form 1 â€“ form 3)

            <span class="line-10"></span>
            <p>The saddest moment of my life so far. After all of us struggling to achieve flying colours 
                for our PT3, we had to say goodbye for those who got accepted to go further by 
                moving to other school. I had to say goodbye to half of my batchmates as they parted ways 
                to go to various MRSM like Tun Ghaffar Baba (TGB) and Taiping. 
                Before that, we do some activities together while waiting for our PT3 results. 
                We somehow managed to watch movies together almost every night in surau, 
                we managed to enter the soldiers camp beside our school. Also, we got free tickets to watch 
                football match! It was really awesome. Im glad we managed to do some great memories before 
                we actually bid goodbye.
            </p>
            <p>I still remember, after we received the names that was accepted to move school, 
                all of us was crying so hard inside the library. And then the teacher 
                played sad songs and almost all of us sobbing so hard. Its funny yet so sad.

                <h1>HELLO NEW VANNERE!</h1>
                <p>Sad moment ended and here we are with new classmates! Both newcomers and originally here were still 
                    shocked and sad, we still slowly opened up to each other. Typical original students did not 
                    welcome new students (from the same batch) but I am very glad that my batchmates are willingly 
                    to open up and accept them! We didnâ€™t have much misunderstanding and we did try our best to 
                    guide since they are new in here. In the end of the day, our bonding is still strong and 
                    we still keep up with each other!
                </p>
                <p>I miss the fact where me and my classmates will have karaoke session when there is no teacher was around. 
                    We also sometimes sing songs during our evening prep. But during night prep, we will all stay silent and 
                    focus on our own stuff or busy doing homework. We were so quiet till the other classes labelled our class 
                    as library or cemetery. Its so funny that they didnâ€™t know what we actually are. Other than karaoke, 
                    we also do story telling and gossiping (typical girls). Oh, I forgot to mention that my class have like 
                    15 girls and only 5 guys. This is why sometimes the guys joined us gossiping too!

            <h1>MORE FUN ACTIVITIES</h1>
            <p>Though we started our new adventure as seniors with new people, lots of things actually changed! 
                We have lots of fun even being seniors. The activities that I listed before were still be done, but it was indeed 
                special senior years for me as I got the chance to experience the Korean Exchange Student Program. 
                I didnâ€™t get the chance to go there, but the students from Korea came here as exchange students! During their last day in MRSM Terendak, 
                I was chosen to be an emcee with my friend. It was a very exciting memory. I was pointed to say something in Korean, 
                so I tried my best to say those word. I practice saying the words over and over. But nonetheless, 
                one of the Korean students told me they didnâ€™t understand what I said. At the very least, I got to experienced being an emcee, right?
            </p>
            <p>Then again, I became an emcee for my batchâ€™s Hi Tea program. That time my voice was not in a very good condition, 
                but thankfully my voice didnâ€™t disappear in the middle of talking. It was not as exciting moment as I being emcee during the exchange student program, 
                but I got the experience of being emcee for my own batchâ€™s program. So i feel at least satisfied that I made it till the end. 
                Other best moment that happened here is during Ungga, where every class (form 5) has to choose a country and decorate our class so we can present the country. 
                My class chose Puerto Rico, and we won the best in all categories! The judges said that we were very passionate like we were the true Puerto Rican. 
                I also wanted to share where I surprised my classmates on my birthday. I asked my mom to brought cakes to MRSM. Then I called my classmates and made a little celebration. 
                Thatâ€™s the first and last time I celebrate my birthday as a MRSM student.
                <br> <br>
                Here I also wanna share that my â€˜Taekwondoâ€™ club finally being active! We finally have lots of tournaments and activities such as grading (exam to increase our belt colour), 
                sparring with other schools, and performances! The first time our school approved doing performance during Tamat Latihan, we won 2nd place! All choreographed by me (yes im proud). 
                Unfortunately, I donâ€™t have record of the performance to attach here.

                    <p>Last day of taking SPM paper, we did a small celebration outside the hall. And then all of us busy 
                        taking pictures with each other and teachers. It was a very sad moment, since it will be last day 
                        as MRSM students. The memories will always stay in my heart and mind. Itâ€™s the end of the story of me, 
                        Melissa Sofeena being a student of MRSM. I included a photo that I like so much, 
                        which is the scenery during dawn in MRSM Terendak. What is more special of that photo, 
                        it was taken on my last night sleeping in MRSM Terendak.
